# 🤟 AI Sign Language Translator
### Real-Time Communication Bridge for Deaf & Hearing Communities


---



**Problem:** 70 million deaf people worldwide struggle to communicate with hearing individuals  
**Solution:** AI system that translates sign language to speech/text and speech to sign language  
**Tech:** Google Gemini Vision AI • Web Speech API • Real-time video processing  
**Impact:** Enables instant two-way communication between deaf and hearing communities  

---

## 🎯 What It Does

```
Sign Language Gestures → AI Vision Analysis → Speech/Text Output
Speech/Text Input → AI Processing → Sign Language Animation
```

**Real Example:** User signs "Hello, how are you?" → System speaks it aloud and displays text

---

## 📊 Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎥 **Sign to Speech** | Translates sign language gestures into spoken words |
| 📝 **Sign to Text** | Converts signs to written text on screen |
| 🗣️ **Speech to Sign** | Translates spoken language into sign language animations |
| ⚡ **Real-Time** | Processes video feed with minimal latency |
| 🌍 **Multi-Language** | Supports ASL, BSL, and other sign languages |
| 📱 **Camera-Based** | Works with standard webcam or phone camera |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**AI/ML:** Google Gemini Vision AI • Computer Vision  
**Frontend:** React • Web Speech API • Video Processing  
**Backend:** Node.js • WebRTC  
**Deployment:** Google AI Studio • Local deployment ready

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-translator.git
cd sign-language-translator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm start

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Try in AI Studio:

⚡ **Open in Google AI Studio:** [Launch App](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/18WwjCwZbUikMn900l0oD7HFd-vqK1YHw)

---

## 💡 How It Works

### Sign Language to Speech/Text:
1. User performs sign language gestures in front of camera
2. AI analyzes video frames to recognize gestures
3. System converts recognized signs to text
4. Text is spoken aloud using text-to-speech
5. Text displayed on screen simultaneously

### Speech/Text to Sign Language:
1. User speaks into microphone or types text
2. Speech-to-text converts audio to text
3. AI maps text to corresponding sign language gestures
4. System displays sign animations or descriptions
5. Real-time visual feedback provided

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

✅ **Conversations** - Enable real-time dialogue between deaf and hearing individuals  
✅ **Education** - Learn sign language with instant feedback  
✅ **Accessibility** - Make public spaces more inclusive  
✅ **Emergency Services** - Critical communication in urgent situations  
✅ **Customer Service** - Better serve deaf customers  
✅ **Video Calls** - Add sign language translation to video meetings  

---

## 📈 Impact Potential

**70 Million Deaf People Worldwide:**
- 466 million people with hearing loss globally (WHO)
- Communication barriers in employment, healthcare, education
- Limited access to real-time interpretation services
- Existing solutions expensive and not always available

**This Tool Provides:**
- Free, accessible communication bridge
- Instant translation without human interpreter
- Privacy (no third-party interpreter needed)
- Available 24/7 on any device with camera
